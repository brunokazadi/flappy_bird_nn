The Flappy Bird Neural Network Player is designed to autonomously play the Flappy Bird game by training a neural network.

The game graphics are implemented using Pygame, and the neural network is built with the help of NumPy and SciPy.

Requirements
Before running the Flappy Bird Neural Network Player, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

Python 3.x
Pygame
NumPy
SciPy
You can install these dependencies using pip: pip install pygame numpy scipy

Execute the Python script that runs the game player: python3 main.py

Observe the game as the neural network attempts to play Flappy Bird automatically.
